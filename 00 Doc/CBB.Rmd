  Data Visualization Project 4: NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Statistics for the 2014-2015 Season
===
  **Bryan Amaefule, Shannon Lu, Kevin Lee**
  
  It's officially November, meaning the start of the college basketball season is just a few weeks away. Last season we saw Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski(yes, that's really how you spell his name) lead his Blue Devils to their sixteenth Final Four appearance, and their fifth National Championship. We saw the (almost)undefeated Kentucky Wildcats have their dream of a perfect season, and spot in the history books, cut short by Frank Kaminsky and the Wisconsin Badgers. With the drama of the 2015-2016 season on the horizon it was only fitting that we choose a baketball-centric subject for this project. We acquired statistic from the 2014-2015 season of NCAA Division I Men's Basketball.

**Background Information**
To begin with, here are the statistics supplied in the datset and their abbreviations
  
  AST=Assists 
  
  BLK=Blocks 
  
  DRB=Defensive Rebounds 
  
  FG=Field Goals Made 
  
  FGA=Field Goal Attempts  
  
  FT=Free Throws Made 
  
  FTA=Free Throws Attempted 
  
  G=Games played 
  
  MP=Minutes Played 
  
  ORB=Offensive Rebounds 
  
  PF=Personal Fouls 
  
  PTS=Total Points Scored 
  
  STL=Steals 
  
  ThreeP=Three Pointers Made 
  
  ThreePA=Three Pointers Attempted 
  
The dataset includes other information about the players such as: the school they play for, the conference they play in, the position(s) they play, and their classification(freshman, sophomore, etc.) 

It takes a good amount of skill and talent to make it on to a Division I college basketball team, it also takes quite a bit of versitility. As such, many players have developed skillsets suitable to play more than one position. Players who play multiple positions have primary position listed first then their secondary position, separated by a hyphen. So a player whose position say 'F-C' is primarily a Forward but can switch over to the center position. And a player whose position says 'C-G' is probably Anthony Davis and thus way too good to be playing college basketball in the first place.
